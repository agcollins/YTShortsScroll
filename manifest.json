  "description": "Tired of manually scrolling after a YouTube short is finished? Try this out. Once a YouTube short is finished, the down arrow is pressed, skipping the looping behavior. This should also work when a tab is not in focus, but not currently when it is in the background. For now, this behavior happens on every YouTube short that runs. I plan to add configuration options for skipping certain videos based on criteria such as like/dislike ratio, number of likes, etc.",
